# Concurrent Weather Data App

## Overview

This is a weather application built using SwiftUI and Swift's modern concurrency system. The app fetches weather data concurrently from a public weather API and displays it to the user as each data point finishes loading. It showcases how to leverage async/await, `Task`, and `TaskGroup` for efficient and responsive fetching of data.

## Features

- Concurrent fetching of weather data for multiple components:
  - Current conditions
  - 5-day forecast
  - Weather radar/map
  - Air quality data
  - Weather alerts or warnings
- Display data immediately as it finishes loading
- Show loading indicators while data is loading
- Error handling for failed network requests
- Refresh button to reload all weather data
- Light and dark mode support
- Location-based weather data (currently set to Almaty)

## Advanced Features (Optional for Higher Grades)

- Data cancellation support for ongoing data fetch operations
- Ability to search for different locations
- Data caching to improve performance
- Detailed views for weather components
- UI transitions and animations

## Weather APIs Used

The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides current conditions, forecasts, air quality data, and more. You can register for an API key here: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Features Implemented

### Core Features
Concurrent Data Loading: The app loads multiple weather data components concurrently using Swiftâ€™s modern concurrency system (async/await, Task, TaskGroup).
Weather Data Display: Displays current conditions, a 5-day forecast, weather radar/map, air quality data, and weather alerts.
Responsive UI: The UI updates immediately as data becomes available, with loading indicators shown while data is being fetched.
Error Handling: Provides error feedback when data loading fails.
Refresh Button: Reloads all weather data when pressed.

## Concurrency Implementation

### Task and TaskGroup
- The app uses async/await along with Task and TaskGroup to load weather data concurrently.
- Each weather data component (current conditions, forecast, etc.) is fetched in parallel.
- The UI is updated as soon as data for each component is available, rather than waiting for all requests to complete.
- Error Handling
- Errors are handled gracefully, with error messages displayed in the UI when a request fails.
- Loading states are clearly indicated, and users are notified of errors in the network requests.

## Code Structure

Model: Represents the weather data and network responses.
ViewModel: Contains business logic and handles data fetching.
View: Contains the SwiftUI views that present the data to the user.
